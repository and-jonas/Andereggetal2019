## Content  

Folder `Utils` contains functions for the pre-processing of spectra, calculation and evaluation of spectral indices, training and evaluation of full-spectrum models, recursive feature elimination and analysis of variance. 

Folder `Analysis`contains scripts to implement the analysis and obtain results contained in the study. 

## Details: Functions

### 001_spectra_utils.R

1. `f_spc_smooth` applies the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter to raw spectra (wrapper for `prospectr::SavitzkyGolay`)
2. `f_spc_avg` averages replicate measurements
3. `f_calc_si`calculates spectral indices
4. `f_calc_sen_si` calculates all spectral indices of the form of the PSRI, to enable the wavelength sensitivity analysis
5. `f_scale_si` scales spectral indices and predictions obtained from full-spectrum model to range from 0 to 10
6. `f_spc_bin` computes average values of a signal in pre-determined bins (wrapper for `prospectr::binning`)
7. `f_spc_trim` removes noisy parts of the signal in pre-determined ranges
8. `f_cont_rem` performs continuum removal (wrapper for `prospectr::ContinuumRemoval`)
9. `f_match_join` joins spectral and scoring datasets by assessment/measurement dates, using a supplied template of matching dates. This function also adds growing degree days for scoring and measurement time points.
10. `get_errors_and_dynpars`Performs linear interpolation of scorings and index values (data in growing degree days after heading),  extracts dynamics parameters and calculates overall error between the two fitted curves. Parametric models instead of linear interpolation are also supported.


### 002_full_spc_utils.R

1. `get_rmse` calculates the root mean square error (RMSE) 
2. `perform_sampling` performs up- or down-sampling to create balanced evaluation datasets (wrapper for `caret::upSample` or `caret::downSample`)
3. `get_RMSE_sample` calculates the root mean square error (RMSE) of up- or downsamples
4. `extract_predobs` creates predictions using a fitted model and extracts the corresponding real observations
5. `eval_full_spc_cross` fits full-spectrum models, extracts performance metrics, performs sampling and extracts predobs for these samples, performs all possible variants of leave-year(s)-out cross-validation. This is essentially a wrapper function for `ranger::ranger` and `Cubist::cubist` using `caret::train` and `caret::trainControl`.

### 003_rfe_utils.R

1. `perform_rfe` performs recursive feature elimination using random forest or cubist regression as base learners. This is essentially a wrapper function for `ranger::ranger` and `Cubist::cubist` using `caret::train` and `caret::trainControl`.
2. `tidy_rfe_output` gathers results of resamples and creates summary statistics of performance and feature ranks.
3. `plot_perf_profile` creates simple performance profile plots.

### 004_h2_BLUEs_utils.R

1. `f_spats` fits the SpATS model to raw plot-based data (wrapper for `SpATS::SpATS`)
2. `spat_corr_spats` computes spatially corrected values for each experimental plot from the spats object (`object$intercept` + `object$coeff`+ `object$residuals`).  
3. `get_h2` calculates heritability across years using spatially corrected plot values and the formula proposed by Cullis. 

## Details: Scripts

1. `01_prep_spcdat.R` Prepare spectral datasets for evaluation of spectral indices and full-spectrum models.
2. `02_full_spc_cv.R` Train and evaluate full-spectrum models
3. `03_perform_rfe.R` An example script that performs rfe using cubist as base learner for the selection of the most important wavelengths to predict visual senescence scorings in 2016. 
4. `04_get_dynpars.R`
